	description "Unlike the electron beam, which was developed first as a fixed weapon and then mounted to a turret for capital ships, the electron repeater was designed as a more versatile version of the turret, but was afterwards offered in smaller, fixed variants to fit in gun ports as well."

	description "The power of the electron turret changed human warfare virtually overnight. The raw sustained damage it could output meant that ships could be disabled or destroyed faster than ever before. The only serious drawback of the weapon was its slow turn rate, unable to track fast targets adequately."
	description "	Alternate Sky purchased the right to design a variant of the electron beam to address this drawback. The electron repeater, rather than being a beam weapon, fires electron bolts in bursts, resulting in slightly less damage and slightly higher range. This change also allows it to be slightly smaller, resulting in faster turn rates. This, coupled with the improved range, enables it to perform better against fast-moving targets."

	description "The Close-In Weapon System, or CIWS, is a reinvention of an old human weapon. Originally designed as an anti-missile system, this cousin of the millennia-old design has been repurposed as a powerful, short range offensive weapon. The sheer volume of projectiles it fires can absolutely shed the hull of a ship, but it also generates a lot of heat as so many bullets travel through the barrel."

	description "In contrast to galactic trends toward slower, heavier-hitting anti-missiles, the HiVAM is engineered for rapid, low-energy fire cycles, capable of engaging swarms of missiles with high success rates. However, it faces a critical weakness in armored projectiles, such as torpedoes, which can often break through the turret's defense."

	description "Aware of the weakness of slow firing, high damage anti-missiles, Alternate Sky developed Starling missiles to overwhelm a ship's defenses. Cheap and easy to produce, each missile is only lightly armored and is individually not that powerful, but in a swarm launched by mutliple Starling missile launchers, they can almost always guarantee penetration of missile defenses and the delivery of explosive firepower to a target."

	description "The Starling missile launcher turret is a more versatile version of the fixed launcher. Each turret has two chain-fed launchers equipped, capable of launching 24 missiles in a single salvo. It is a very potent offensive weapon, capable of overwhelming defenses at extreme range in 360 degrees. Its primary weakness is its dependence on ammunition; since it does not use energy projectiles, it has a very finite number of rounds for something considered to be a primary weapon."

	description "A powerful new weapon available to the human arsenal, the mass driver is a large weapon integrated into the ship along its spine, consisting of a row of magnetic coils that accelerate a ferromagnetic slug up to great speed. The round itself does raw kinetic damage, the force of which can overload a shield matrix and bring down all but the strongest shields in one shot. However, since it's just a piece of metal traveling at high speed, it tends to punch right through a ship's hull, dealing little damage."
